# QuickResistor

QuickResistor is a Jaava tool that allows users to quickly enter the color bands on a resistor and get instantly calculated values. 


## How QuickResistor Works

QuickResistor uses a JavaScript function to interpret the color codes entered by the user and calculate the resistance value, tolerance, and temperature coefficient of the resistor. The color codes are matched to a lookup table of values, which are then used in the calculation.
